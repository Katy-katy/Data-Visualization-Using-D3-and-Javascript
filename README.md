It is a programming assignment for my upper division “Data Programming For Visualization” class at University of California Santa Cruz. 

The program read read the data from “scatterdata.csv” and visualize it using D3 Javascript library. https://d3js.org/ 
The visualization has tooltip - when the user hovers the pointer over an item, without clicking it, a small box with information about the country appears.

The visualization also has pan and zoom functions. Thus, it is possible to drags the scene around with the mouse and to zoom it.
